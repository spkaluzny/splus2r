Changes in splus2R 1.3.3

* The peaks function has a new argument, endbehavior, that controls how
  peaks are defined within less than half the span of the data start
  or end. The default gives the same behavior as peaks in the previous
  version of the package. See the peaks help file for details.

* The details of the peaks function are now coded in C instead of Fortran.

Changes in splus2R 1.2-0

* A new version of the peaks function that uses the Fortran code from
  S-PLUS was added. Huge Mildenberger (Hugo.Mildenberger@web.de) noted
  that the previous version could give incorrect values due to the
  default random handling of ties.  The old version did also did
  not respect the strict argument.

* Minor help file edits.
